        <p>My name is Chandra Pravesh. I am basically from Tamil Nadu but am currently staying in Guntur. Presently, I am pursuing a Bachelor in Computer Application with a Cloud Technology and Information Security Specialization at KL University, Guntur, and I have done schooling and intermediate at Kendriya Vidyalaya No.1 under the Bi.M.P.C stream. I can speak fluently in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and English. <br> <br>

            I am confident that I possess the necessary skills, qualities, and passion for the position. I am a certified Salesforce Administrator and Azure Fundamentals, as well as a comparative Java programmer with a 5-star Hackerrank rating and a 2-star CodeChef Platform rating. I interned as a cyber security engineer for Supraja Technology Pvt. Ltd. for 45 days and as a web developer for BrainOVision Pvt. Ltd. for 30 days. I also wrote a book named "Mobile Application Development" published by Notion Press. I have done two projects: a registration page for a science fair event and a library portal for a department. <br> <br>
           
            My strength is that I am a hard worker, dedicated, and disciplined individual; my weakness is that I generally keep my workspace unclean and unorganized; to overcome this, I am scheduling time in between work to clean my workspace. My short-term goal is to get a job where I can showcase my talent and skills, and my long-term goal is to achieve a good position in the organization. My interests include graphic designing and Reading Books, and in my free time, I usually play video games and surf the Internet. I believe that I am qualify ed for the job as per the job description. <br><br>
